# Slot Game

A simple slot game made in JavaScript and HTML. The sprites were drawn by me.

Rules:
* Start with 300 coins, with each play costing 3 coins
* There are six symbols: cherry, watermelon, diamond, star, bar, and seven
* Match three of the same symbol in a row to win coins
* The amount of coins rewarded is based on the symbol you are matching
